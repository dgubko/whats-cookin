# What's Cookin'?

## Abstract

We have created a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view recipes they want to cook and plan shopping trips around them. The idea is similar to sites like All Recipes or New York Times Cooking. Users are able to view a list of recipes and choose recipes to cook, as well as view the total cost of ingredients for each recipe they select! Users can also add recipes to and remove recipes from their personal saved list. 

## Project Goals and Objectives

- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- TDD Testing: Mocha / Chai
- APIs

## Reflections

### Wins
- We were able to divide the workload pretty evenly
- Fetching the APIs gave us some trouble at first, but we were able to figure it out quickly
- We created a detailed DTR at the start of our project, which greatly improved our ability to work together

### Challenges
- It was challenging to write six classes and get them to interact with each other
- We had to do some research to find technical solutions 
- We had some scheduling conflicts, which made meeting everyone together difficult at times
