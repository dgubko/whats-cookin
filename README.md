# What's Cookin'?

## Abstract

We have created a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view recipes they want to cook and plan shopping trips around them. The idea is similar to sites like All Recipes or New York Times Cooking. Users are able to view a list of recipes and choose recipes to cook, as well as view the total cost of ingredients for each recipe they select! Users can also add recipes to and remove recipes from their personal saved list. 

## Project Goals and Objectives

- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data

## Set Up

1. Within your group, decide on one person to have the project repository on their Github account. This person will *fork* this repository - on the top right corner of the page, click the fork button.
2. All group members should then clone down the forked repository (make sure that everyone is added as a collaborator as well). Since you don't want your project to be named "whats-cookin-starter-kit", add an optional argument after the repo url when cloning. The command should look like this: `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`.
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install project dependencies.
4. Run npm start in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page). `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server. Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use.
5. Make sure both members of your team are collaborators on the forked repo.
6. Do not run `npm audit fix --force`. This will update to the latest version of packages. We need to be using `webpack-dev-server@3.11.2` which is not the latest version. If you start to run into Webpack errors, first check that all group members are using the correct version.
