# What's Cookin'?

##Part 1

## Abstract

We have created a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view recipes they want to cook and plan shopping trips around them. The idea is similar to sites like All Recipes or New York Times Cooking. Users are able to view a list of recipes and choose recipes to cook, as well as view the total cost of ingredients for each recipe they select! Users can also add recipes to and remove recipes from their personal saved list. 

## Project Goals and Objectives

- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data

## Project Install

1. Go to [this repository](https://github.com/dgubko/whats-cookin) on Github
2. Click "Fork", then "Create New Fork"
3. Click "Code"
4. Copy the SSH url provided by GitHub
5. In the terminal, navigate to the new project repository
6. Type "git clone" and paste the URL
7. Open the repo in your text editor
8. In your terminal, run "npm install", "npm start", then go to "http://localhost:8080/" in your browser
9. Manipulate the application in the browser window

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- TDD Testing: Mocha / Chai
- APIs

## Reflections

### Wins
- We were able to divide the workload pretty evenly
- Fetching the APIs gave us some trouble at first, but we were able to figure it out quickly
- We created a detailed DTR at the start of our project, which greatly improved our ability to work together

### Challenges
- It was challenging to write six classes and get them to interact with each other
- We had to do some research to find technical solutions 
- We had some scheduling conflicts, which made meeting everyone together difficult at times

## Project Goals and Objectives

  - Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.
  - Refactor your code to DRY up repetitive logic
  - Ensure your app follows best practices for accessibility
  - Practice talking about your code and high level technical concepts
  - Implement feedback to improve product and process.

## Project Install

1. Go two these two repositories
  - Go to [this repository](https://github.com/dgubko/whats-cookin) on Github
  - Go to [this repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/whats-cookin-api) on Github
2. Click "Fork", then "Create New Fork"

## Reflections

### Wins
- We were able to divide the workload pretty evenly
- Posting to the APIs and then fetching the updated data was challenging however, we were able to figure it out 
- We created a detailed DTR at the start of our project, which greatly improved our ability to work together

### Challenges
- Posting data to the api proved to be very difficult. We struggled to allow the user to input information into their pantry and have that update the users api. Once it was updated we also struggled to get that new information to update the DOM.
- We had to do some research to find technical solutions 
- Similar to our first challenge, removing information when a user cooks a recipe was also difficult.
